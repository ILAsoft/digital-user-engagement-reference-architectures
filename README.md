### SES Event Processing

#### Description

Like many other IT functions, sending emails requires operational oversight and ongoing management.  One such consideration for executing any email delivery is reputation management by means of event processing.  SES should be configured to emit events regarding email sends.  Many events can be generated by SES, but two that are of high concern are Bounces (the recipient's mail server permanently rejected the email) and Complaints (the email was successfully delivered to the recipient, however recipient marked the email as spam).  Failing to respond to these events will damage sending reputation.

The architecture below shows how SES can be configured to emit events to SNS which is then routed to a Lambda for processing.  The Lambda function should then evaluate the events and for Bounces and Complaints, update the email address source database and remove the offending addresses from future sends.

Additionally, the Lambda function should be configured to make use of the SES Account Level Suppression List functionality to automatically suppress this email address from future sends.

### Pinpoint Event Processing

#### Description

Like many other IT functions, sending emails requires operational oversight and ongoing management.  One such consideration for executing any email delivery is reputation management by means of event processing.  Pinpoint should be configured to emit events regarding email sends.  Many events can be generated by Pinpoint, but two that are of high concern are Bounces (the recipient's mail server permanently rejected the email) and Complaints (the email was successfully delivered to the recipient, however recipient marked the email as spam).

The Lambda function should then evaluate the events and for Bounces and Complaints, update the email address source database and remove the offending addresses from future sends.

Additionally, the Lambda function should be configured to make use of the SES Account Level Suppression List, functionality shared across both SES and Pinpoint, to automatically suppress this email address from future sends.

### Pinpoint S3 Data Lake

#### Description

Sending outbound messages with Pinpoint allows you to track engagement events both in the Pinpoint console and programmatically by consuming the raw events that Pinpoint (and SES) generate.  These events provide a wealth of knowledge on how your end-users are engaging with your messaging and Pinpoint allows you to stream these events to S3 to create a data lake which is excellent for mining, analysis, and future machine learning training and retraining.  

The architecture below shows how Pinpoint can be configured to emit events through Kinesis Firehose into Amazon S3.  This solution uses an API configuration that will use Amazon SES for email events by configuring the Pinpoint email channel to use a SES configuration set.  In this way, we are able to create a Kinesis Firehose per event type which allows us to better partition these events in S3 and ultimately allow Glue to index them easily as separate entities.

#### Architecture Diagram

#### Use-Case

* Data Mining
* Engagement Scoring
* Engagement Analysis
* Campaign Reporting
* Click and Open Tracking
* Machine Learning Training / Retraining

### Add / Remove from Segments via Event Activity

#### Description

Amazon Pinpoint can act as an event hub for events generated by engaging with end users (Email Opens, Email Clicks, Email Complaints, SMS Sends, etc).  Pinpoint can also be used to stream custom events from applications via the PutEvents API.  This is how AWS Amplify sends events to Pinpoint about mobile and web applications.  All of these events can be streamed out of Pinpoint via the Pinpoint Event Stream allowing all of these events to be routed to the same destination for processing or storage.  A common pattern is to use these events to target endpoints into Pinpoint Segments.  Pinpoint's Dynamic Segment functionality allows for users to generate segments for Campaign or Journey targeting based on custom endpoint attributes.

The architecture below shows how an AWS Lambda function can be used to read the events coming from the Pinpoint event stream via Kinesis in order to find specific events that will trigger Endpoint attributes to be updated in near real time.  The deployed Lambda function looks for email open events and custom webinar registration events.

Using this example, a marketer could create a Dynamic Segment in Pinpoint of users who have opened an email (attribute "email_opened" = "true") and who have registered for Webinar 5 (attribute "webinar_registration" = "webinar5").  This segment will be continuously updated so that Campaigns and Journeys would always have the most recent data.

#### Use-Case

* Using Event Data to create dynamic segments
* Target Users with Campaigns based on custom events
* Target Users with Journeys based on custom events

## Amazon Pinpoint SMS

------

### Self-Managed Opt Outs

#### Description

Managing communication preferences for the SMS channel are very important.  The STOP keyword is an important keyword to monitor when sending out SMS messages to end-users.  By default, AWS will manage the STOP keyword (and other related keywords) on your behalf.  If customers respond with STOP, then AWS will put that phone number on a blacklist per AWS account thereby blocking further communication with that end-user.  This will keep you in compliance will sending SMS messages, but it is not ideal for transactional messaging such as One-Time Passwords, Confirmation Messages, or Receipts.

Amazon Pinpoint allows you to configure Self-Managed Opt Outs which will allow you to bypass AWS's built in controls.  The architecture outlined below takes deploys an SNS Topic and Lambda function that will listen to and respond to the STOP keyword in two-way SMS conversations.

#### Architecture Diagram

![Screenshot](images/Self-managed_Opt_Outs.png)

#### Use-Case

* Adhere to STOP keyword compliance rules
* Still allow for sending Transactional messaging after STOP keyword
* Used in One-Time Password, Confirmation, and Receipt messaging
* Allow other customer systems to be notified of STOP triggers

#### AWS CloudFormation Link
[CF Template](cloudformation/Self-managed_Opt_Outs.yaml)

_NOTE_: Amazon Pinpoint does not allow you to configure two-way SMS or self-managed opt outs via API.  This can only be done via the Console.  After deploying the CloudFormation template, go into Pinpoint and turn on both Two-Way SMS, selecting the newly deployed SNS Topic, and also Self-Managed Opt Out per the documentation linked below.

### Advanced Segmentation with Amazon S3 and Amazon Athena

#### Description

Endpoints stored in Amazon Pinpoint enable customers to store addresses across multiple channels all connected to each other via a UserId to represent a single user.  Endpoints also enable you to store User and Endpoint level attributes to be used in Message personalization and Dynamic Segmentation.  This allows for segmentation like "Where [Attribute Name] is [Some Value]".  Ex:  Select all Email endpoints where the User `CustomerStage` is `Renewal` and User `CustomerValue` is `High`.

Some segmentation use-cases call for more advanced segmentation rules where simple attribute matching will not be sufficient. In these cases, we can use customer's existing Data Lakes in Amazon S3 with Amazon Athena as a query engine.  With these services, customers can create segments with much more specificity. Ex: Select all Email endpoints where the User has made a purchase of red shoes in the last 3 months and has opened more than 15 emails in the last 9 months and has clicked on the website page showing product details of our upcoming shoe release in the last 24 hours.

One option is to create a static import segment from these results that is updated daily.  Another option, and represented in the diagram below, is to update an Endpoint attribute array `AdvancedSegmentTarget` with a token signaling they match the criteria.  The `AdvancedSegmentTarget` array would then contain the names of all of the advanced segments the endpoint matches.  This allows the dynamic segment to be better used in Journeys and Recurring campaigns.  This process could be set up to refresh daily via Amazon CloudWatch events and orchestrated by AWS Step Function.

#### Architecture Diagram

#### Use-Case

* Advanced segmentation rules
* Utilize existing S3 Data Lakes
* Avoid moving data into Pinpoint Attributes that changes frequently

### Send-Time Amazon Pinpoint Campaign Attributes

#### Description

In a typical Marketing Platform, in order to use a value in an email, it must exist inside the Marketing Platform.  This typically involves creating Pipeline processes to select, transform, transfer, and load data from source systems into the Marketing Platform at regular intervals to sync it.  This causes data latency if the data changes frequently, but can also cause long development delays when Marketers want to onboard new sources of data for use in Campaigns.

With Amazon Pinpoint's CampaignHook functionality, data can be retrieved at the time of Campaign execution from any source via a Lambda function that is called in realtime.  The architecture diagram below shows how a Lambda function could be used to fetch a personalized offer from a source data store to be used in the email html without storing the offer in Pinpoint.

#### Architecture Diagram

![Screenshot](images/External_Attributes.png)

#### Use-Case

* Retrieving data in real time with no latency
* Avoid costly and time consuming ETL processes
* Onboard new attributes dynamically

#### AWS CloudFormation Link
[CF Template](cloudformation/External_Attributes.yaml)

#### Documentation References

### External Amazon Pinpoint Campaign Templates

#### Description

Amazon Pinpoint has template management functionality to managed your Email, SMS, Push, and Voice templates for your campaigns.  Many customers, however, already have content in other systems driven by the needs of the Creative team.  Pinpoint is flexible and extensible in that it can fetch whole HTML content from other sources at send time.  

With Amazon Pinpoint's CampaignHook functionality, html and subject lines can be retrieved at the time of Campaign execution from any source via a Lambda function that is called in realtime.  The architecture diagram below shows how a Lambda function could be used to fetch html from a source data store to be used in the campaign.

#### Architecture Diagram

![Screenshot](images/External_Templates.png)

#### Use-Case

* Templates stored in a Content Management System
* Templates managed and owned by separate creative team
* Complex business rules where templates can be internationalized an selected at campaign send time
* Build your own templating engine outside of Pinpoint

#### AWS CloudFormation Link
[CF Template](cloudformation/External_Templates.yaml)

_NOTE_: In the campaign, a message body would need to be used to minimally render the dynamic attribute "html".  An example email body would be:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>{Attributes.html}</html>
```

### Connect (or Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, anything) as a Pinpoint Campaign Channel

#### Description

Amazon Pinpoint has a voice channel that can be used to place outbound calls and play a message.  Amazon Connect is a separate AWS service that has full call center capabilities.  Commonly, customers will want to use Pinpoint's campaign functionality to filter and identify customers to target for an interactive outbound call.

With Amazon Pinpoint's CampaignHook functionality, Amazon Connect can be set up as a custom channel via a Lambda function.  The architecture diagram below shows how a Lambda function could be used to initiate a realtime call to Connect to place an outbound call.

It is important to note that this same Lambda Pinpoint CampaignHook feature can be used to build any custom channel.  Customers are not limited to other AWS services.

#### Architecture Diagram

![Screenshot](images/Connect_as_a_Channel.png)

#### Use-Case

* Appointment Confirmation:  You have an appointment soon.  Push 1 to confirm, Press 2 to speak to someone about rescheduling
* Automatically connect customers to agents
* Use an advanced IVR system for interactivity with customers

#### AWS CloudFormation Link
[CF Template](cloudformation/Connect_as_a_Channel.yaml)


_NOTE_: This example uses the Pinpoint channel type of SMS.  Via the UI, a message can be passed to the Lambda function by providing an SMS message during the Campaign creation process.  

This also assumes that an Amazon Connect Instance, Queue, and Contact Flow have been set up and created prior to launching the CloudFormation template.  These are required parameters for the template.
